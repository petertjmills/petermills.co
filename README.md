Hopefully if you're seeing this, it means you're on contentful or on the GitHub repo.
This is where you'll keep articles.
There is a single level hierarchy of articles.
You have:
[Collection]
    - [Article]

Define collections using Tags on contentful.
Each new tag you create it will create a new collection on the website that will show in the menu.
Menu items for now are displayed alphabetically,
The `Main` tag is excluded from the menu.

The rest should be self explanatory.


If you would like features added open a new issue on the github repo at 
github.com/petertjmills/e-clare2

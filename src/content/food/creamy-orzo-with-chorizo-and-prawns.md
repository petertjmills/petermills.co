## Ingredients

- 200g uncooked orzo pasta
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1 red pepper, finely diced
- 200g cherry tomatoes
- 1 courgette (zucchini), finely diced
- 1 red onion, finely diced
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed
- 100g chorizo, chopped into small chunks
- 1 tbsp sun-dried tomato puree
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 heaped tbsp half-fat creme fraiche
- Fresh basil, stems chopped separately
- 30g Parmesan cheese
- 2 packs (165g each) raw king prawns
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 lemon
- Olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Prepare the Prawns: In a bowl, combine the raw king prawns with minced garlic, the juice of half a lemon, and a drizzle of olive oil. Set this mixture aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish.

2. Chop Vegetables: Dice the red pepper, cherry tomatoes, courgette (zucchini), and red onion into fine pieces.

3. Sauté Chorizo and Onions: In a large saucepan over medium heat, add the chopped chorizo and diced red onion. Sauté for a few minutes until the onion softens and the chorizo releases its flavorful oil.

4. Add Vegetables: To the saucepan, add crushed garlic, red pepper, courgette, cherry tomatoes, sun-dried tomato puree, and tomato puree. Also, add the chopped basil stems. Mix well and sauté for 5-10 minutes until the vegetables have cooked down.

5. Incorporate Orzo: Add the uncooked orzo pasta and smoked paprika to the vegetable mixture. Pour in enough water to just submerge the ingredients. Crumble in the chicken stock cube and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix everything together.

6. Simmer: Cover the saucepan with a lid and gently simmer for 15-20 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Add a bit more water if it starts to get too dry.

7. Finish the Dish: Once the orzo is cooked and has a creamy consistency, add a little more water to loosen it up if needed. Squeeze in the juice of 1/4 of a lemon, sprinkle in the grated Parmesan cheese, add the creme fraiche, and a large handful of chopped basil. Fold everything together and season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Cook the Prawns: Heat a separate frying pan and add the marinated prawns. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Pan-fry the prawns for 2-3 minutes, tossing them until they are cooked through.

9. Serve: Serve the creamy orzo alongside the pan-fried prawns. Garnish with additional fresh basil leaves and a lemon wedge if desired.

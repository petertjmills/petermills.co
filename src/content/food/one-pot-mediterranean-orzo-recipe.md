Ingredients

- 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
- 1 brown onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, finely diced
- ½ tsp dried chili flakes
- ½ tsp dried oregano
- 1 punnet grape tomatoes
- 2 tbsp capers in brine
- 1/3 cup Pitted Kalamata Olives
- 1 cup dried orzo pasta
- 1 400g tin Chickpeas, drained
- 600ml vegetable stock
- ½ jar Roasted Peppers, cut into strips
- Large handful of flatleaf parsley
- 200g marinated feta

Instructions

1. Warm a large frying pan over medium/high heat. Add the olive oil, onion, garlic, chili, oregano, and a generous pinch of salt. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until the onion softens.

2. Stir in the tomatoes, capers, olives, and orzo. Continue to cook and stir for another 2 minutes.

3. Next, mix in the chickpeas and vegetable stock. Allow the mixture to simmer, then reduce the heat to low. Continue to stir regularly for 3-4 minutes.

4. Scatter the roasted peppers over the top of your simmering mixture, then cover the pan with a lid. Let it simmer for 15 minutes, until it has turned creamy and the orzo has soaked up all the liquid and softened.

5. Roughly chop half the parsley and mix it into the dish along with half of the feta.

6. Serve your delightful Mediterranean Orzo sprinkled with the remaining feta and parsley leaves. Top it off with a dash of black pepper and an optional drizzle of olive oil for that extra dash of flavor.

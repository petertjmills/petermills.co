## Ingredients

- 1 Essential Aubergine
- 2½ tbsp Essential Olive Oil
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 1 clove garlic, thinly sliced
- ½ tsp chilli flakes (adjust to your spice preference)
- 1 tbsp sundried tomato paste
- 400g jar Mutti Passata Tuscany Rossoro Tomatoes
- 200g pennoni rigati pasta
- ½ x 250g Oatly! Creamy Oat
- 5 sprigs oregano, leaves picked, plus extra for garnish

## Instructions

1. Prepare Aubergine: Quarter the aubergine lengthways, then cut it into 1cm slices. Heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the aubergine slices with a pinch of salt for about 3-4 minutes on each side until they start to become golden and tender. You might need to do this in two batches. Once done, transfer the aubergine to a plate and set it aside.

2. Cook Onions and Flavor Base: In the same pan, add the remaining ½ tbsp of olive oil. Add the thinly sliced onion with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes until the onion becomes softened. Stir in the sliced garlic and chilli flakes, cooking for an additional 30 seconds. Spoon in the sundried tomato paste and cook for about 1 minute. Then, pour in the Mutti Passata Tuscany Rossoro Tomatoes and bring the mixture to a simmer.

3. Prepare Pasta: While the sauce is simmering, cook the pennoni rigati pasta according to the package instructions. Be sure to reserve about a cup of the pasta water before draining.

4. Combine Ingredients: Stir the aubergine slices and creamy oat drink into the tomato sauce along with most of the picked oregano leaves. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return the cooked pasta to the pan it was cooked in, then add the sauce. Mix everything well to ensure the pasta is evenly coated. If needed, add a splash of pasta water to loosen the sauce.

5. Serve: Divide the Creamy Aubergine and Tomato Pasta between 2 bowls. Scatter the remaining oregano leaves on top for garnish.

I suppose it's been a while again... I'm struggling to think of ways to keep this up. I guess habit is the only way. I find myself taking breaks and then struggling to get back into the flow of writing, which ends in a feedback loop of not writing. I feel a lull in motivation generally. I've been playing around some more with blender, doing some aesthetic stuff, and coming up with a way to scrape Google arts and culture. While I'm on that thought here is my current plan:

- Stick the API on hetzner
- api receives data from local sqlite database
- gets image from gac
- stores image in minio
- stores data in postgres
- returns data to client
- if google rate limits, kill the server and start a new one. (this is gonna be manual. If i try to automate it I'll defo corrupt something)

We'll see how this goes.

I'm really stuck at the moment. I really want a good ssh tunnel manager, but I really cant be bothered to make one. Maybe I'll have a look at go GUI again and see if I can use that to put something together. Will be a fun little go project but I said that about the swift project.

I don't know if I've written this and cant be bothered to check but faasd implemented my pr after a little bit of [debate](https://github.com/openfaas/faasd/issues/340#issuecomment-1722270733). But it's there now so I'm happy. At the time I thought it was unnecessary to deliberate this so much, on their part, but in retrospect they're an open source project. Maybe it's just quite hard, and they have to be a little sceptical sometimes.

I'm going to make some improvements to this website tomorrow. I've just decided to, and written it down imperatively like that so now I have to. I'll add a gallery for my art and start thinking about a section to talk about media and stuff. Maybe implement something with spotify because having my music on the website would be cool.

A new idea I've been thinking about is writing some short stories. Probably quite surreal short stories, very stream of consciousness, and experiment with an idea I've had for a while; as stories progress with characters, jump to another character randomly and never go back to the original character. Use this to carry themes rather than attachments to characters and human form, but also as an exploration of the absurd random encounters we have with everyone around us. Maybe post them on bluesky cause that'd be fun. I've never seen fictional threads on twitter or anything.

I went to the Tate yesterday so I've been thinking about that. Thinking about the gallery as a museum of human expression. It's not a novel thought or anything, and barely interesting, but it's useful as a tool for people that don't get art galleries too much. Especially people that complain about not liking the art. I think it's besides the point. The point is seeing what people can do, and can create in novel ways. But then maybe that's just my interpretation as someone who likes it, making this a meaningless point. Meaningless to others anyway.

Finally, I've started waking up really early. We'll see how long it lasts. But getting stuff done at 7 before work is so fun. Still tired, start programming and I feel like I fall into a flow quickly. I don't get wound up by decision debt, I just start doing stuff and seeing what works, which is very rewarding. It's probably the way all programming and computer stuff should be.

First entry. Will try and do everyday.

Today I got email writing to planetscale for usedteslas.co.uk / stip. Schema probably isn't ideal but doesn't matter too much. Writing lots of JSON and this means lots of space used. For stip I still need to work out how to provide email workers as a service.

Took a 3 photos on a walk. Not much to be excited about. I don't think they will be very good.

Chicken Katsu Curry for lunch and Tomato and Basil Risotto for dinner. The tomatoes have been homegrown by Sophie, and need using.

Fifty eight percent of the way through On the Road by Kerouac.

I've been thinking today about two notable things: 1. The acknowledgement of your existence attained by the interaction of yourself and a stranger that lives outside of your world. How this seems to justify that you exist in a universe much larger than your own. 2. That your tongue knows what everything feels if you licked it. Even if you've never licked it before.

Another day of very little. I had to nap after work because I my eyes were shutting. Slept too long, naturally and felt rough in the evening.

I made the save draft work on used teslas, but I need to work out how to save images. This is all a prerequisite to getting stripe payment stuff working. Need to be able to save the form before payment. After that I need to sort out front-end + preview stuff. I can come back to the dashboard after that, to add stuff like user details etc. It's just quite urgent I get the front end going for some good SEO etc.

This evening I had a sirloin steak for dinner. Cooked it in butter. Incredible. Seasoned with a little too much salt though. Sweet potato chips and asparagus on the side, roasted, heavily seasoned.

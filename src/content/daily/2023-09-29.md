There has been a slight gap. I haven't posted in a while, and I've lost a lot of momentum. I feel like with this productivity thing I've been pulling on the engine starter and I've been choking, rumbling for a little while and petering out quickly. That's what happened this week. I lost momentum. I think there is something in doing half an hour every day rather than just something, because half an hour get you into it, into flow. Something is just a tick box exercise. Half an hour can be a lot of work. Anyway, the break is over and it's been nice. Need to get back into it.

I can't really recap much. In the last week I have been spending evenings watching TV or playing GTA V for the first time properly. Playing a lot of guitar and thinking about things like the sky and cool aesthetics.

Have been playing with blender and some metalheart style stuff. Need to get a good set of modifiers working for this. Going to experiment more.

As a "get back into it" to-do I want to make this website a bit better. I want to add a photo section.

I also want to add a list of books, films, music I like. Should get on that

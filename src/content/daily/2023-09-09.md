I'm drumk.

I was wrong (for now) about being scammed open source. I got the complete wrong end of grafana and provisioning. I assumed the `/etc/grafana/provisioning` was for persistant storage. It wasn't at all the case. Provisioning I thing means whenyou make a folder that the container uses as root. I've set it as that.

Provisioning I think means provisisoning the daemon to default to something but I wanted it to do something that I wanted it do. Save persistant logs. So far I've got it to produce Loki logs.

Anyway I'm drunk so let's get to what I'm good at now. I'm thinking about he genoious of andy wetheralll and tje amazingment that is move on op. It's an incredible track. I love the guitar but I'm all about the vibe

With rough pencil scratchings I worked out that it would take around 500 days to complete 33 rounds of fights, for all 8 billion people, given 20 million fighting arenas. Not that long at all.

I did a little on used teslas today, not stripe integrations, because I couldn't be bothered. I did some aesthetic and menu stuff. Small steps.

I'm tired this weekend, taking it easy. Not thinking too much. I have a song I've been playing around with in open C. Has a few parts. Needs a melody. I should really think about recording.

I do need to jot down an idea for chroma:

Database backed useState for react. Chroma tree is based on it's position in the component tree, and that's how it knows what and where to query. Needs some more thought but has legs as a good tool. More thoughts coming.

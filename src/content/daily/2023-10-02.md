Another short one. I'm still struggling with motivation. Is it possible for a company like mondragon to maintain an oasis in the desert?

I've been making stuff on blender today:

I'm going to write lyrics but I don't care about the lyrics meaning anything. Stream of consciousness poetry like Patti Smith in the Rolling Thunder Revue.

Had a podcast idea. A podcast of complete nonsense, meaningless conversation, that on hearing a few seconds sounds like a podcast but listening it is just sentences that don't mean anything or have any relation to each other being spoken, convincingly. It's an art project, a statement on podcasts maybe.

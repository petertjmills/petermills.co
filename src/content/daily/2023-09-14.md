Rough day today. Exhausting day at work, felt like three days in one. Been taking it easy.

Not too much to say. Did a bit of used teslas, and looked at my painting. Stripe integration and the pricing bit of the form. I'm going to say in future it's like 2 days of work to get stripe working. Not too trivial. There is a gap for a good stripe react library. v0 from vercel looks like it's gonna change everything.

I saw a man change a street light bulb at lunch. I've never wondered how many people it takes to change a street light bulb. The health and safety administrator, the large bulb procurement officer, the head of electrical affairs, and the commercial director of city lighting contracts (CLC). He did a good job. I wanted to take a photo, it would have been a good one too, but I didn't just enjoyed the moment.
